  - "The storage indicates the number of particles inside the cell, that can reach
    up to 5.\r\n\r\nIf the cell attempts to introduce new particles once the max has
    been reached, it will loose all its energy.\r\n"
  - "The \"If storage\" task allows you to choose different actions depending on the
    cell's storage.\r\n\r\nIf the storage value is higher than the value introduced
    in the code, the cell will perform the next task. Otherwise, the next task will
    be avoided.\r\n"
  - "Objective:\r\n\r\nMake use of the \"If storage\" task to process 10 particles
    keeping other 4 particles inside the cell.\r\n"

  - "So far, only positive particles have appeared. From now on, other type of particles
    will appear, with different effects for the cell.\r\n\r\nOn this level, neutral
    particles are introduced. They are square shaped and are inoffensive for the cell."
  - "The \"Respiration\" task allows you to process particles. Depending on the type
    of particle, processing it will have different outcomes:\r\n\r\n- Positive particle:
    +3 energy. Turns into neutral particle.\r\n- Neutral particle: +0 energy. Turns
    into positive particle."
  - "The \"Color\" task has also been added and it allows you to change the color
    of the cell.\r\n\r\nIf its used right before some tasks, it allows you to visualize
    instructions that take a while to complete like \"Respiration\" or \"Endocytosis\".\r\n"
  - "Objective:\r\n\r\nPerform the \"Respiration\" task 6 times."

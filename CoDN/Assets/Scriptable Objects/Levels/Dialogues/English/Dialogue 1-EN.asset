  - "You can modify the cell's behaviour programing its genetic code.\r\n\r\nAdd instructions
    from the task list pressing leftclick on your mouse. Once the code is ready, press
    the Play button."
  - "You may reorder the tasks in the code dragging them to the desired position.\r\n\r\nTo
    eliminate an instruction, you can drag them out of the code or press the button
    with the bin icon to delete\r\nall the tasks."
  - "Once the simulation has started, the cell will do the tasks on the given order.\r\n\r\nAltering
    the code order during the simulation won't change the behaviour of the cell."
  - "Right now you can use 2 instructions:\r\n\r\nEndocytosis: the cell introduces
    the first particle that makes contact with itself.\r\n \r\nExocytosis: extracts
    the first particle that was introduced in the cell."
  - "Objective:\r\n\r\nMake the cell extract 4 particles via exocytosis."

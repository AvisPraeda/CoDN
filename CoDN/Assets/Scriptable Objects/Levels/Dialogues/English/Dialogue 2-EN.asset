  - "The jump instruction allows you to set any line from the code as the next instruction.\r\n\r\nTo
    use it, add the \"Jump\" task and introduce the number of the line of code you
    want to set as the next instruction.\r\nIt is specially useful to return to previous
    tasks or to avoid subsequent lines of code.\r"
  - "Objective:\r\n\nIntroduce 6 particles in the cell without adding more than 3
    instructions to the code.\r You can modify the simulation speed using the scrollbar
    bellow the code.\n\nNote that the cell can't store more than 5 particles at the
    same time."
